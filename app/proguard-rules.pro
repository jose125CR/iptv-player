# libtorrent4j - the native side resolves these SWIG-generated classes, their constructors
# and their `swigCPtr`/`getCPtr` members by exact name/signature, so renaming or stripping
# any of them breaks every native call with no compile-time warning: the release build
# crashed the moment a torrent was played while debug (unminified) was fine.
# (This block named com.frostwire.jlibtorrent.** until 2.5 - the engine moved to
# libtorrent4j, see TorrentEngine's kdoc for why, and the rule was never moved with it.)
