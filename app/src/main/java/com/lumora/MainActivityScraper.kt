/**
 * Streaming from the built-in site scrapers (`com.lumora.scraper`).
 *
 * The scrapers are not a catalogue - see [ScraperCatalog]. Lumora's catalogue for this content is
 * Discover/TMDB, and this file turns a title the user is already looking at there into something
 * playing.
 *
 * **It plays; it does not ask.** An embed host is not a meaningful choice - the names are
 * interchangeable CDNs, nobody can tell a working one from a dead one by looking at it, and a
 * list of thirty is a worse experience than the app simply trying them. So this starts the first
 * source it gets and, when one fails to resolve, moves to the next without comment. This is how
 * the upstream scraper app behaves too: it plays `preferredServer ?: servers.first()` immediately
 * and, on a failed extraction, silently advances to `servers[i + 1]` until the list runs out.
 *
 * Two properties make it work. Sources are tried *as they arrive* rather than after every site
 * has answered, so playback starts at the speed of the fastest site rather than the slowest. And
 * whichever host played last is floated to the front next time, so a setup that works keeps
 * working instead of re-walking the same dead hosts on every launch.
 *
 * A manual list is still one press away, for the case the automatic order gets wrong.
