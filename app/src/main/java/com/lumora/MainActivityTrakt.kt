// ── Trakt: device sign-in, scrobbling, watched sync ──
//
// Extracted from MainActivity.kt; see that file's header.
//
// Three separable jobs, gated by two independent toggles (see TraktStore):
//
//   1. Sign-in     - the device flow, run from the Settings pane.
//   2. Scrobbling  - /scrobble/start|pause|stop as the player runs. Trakt decides watched
//                    state from where a stop lands, so the app never asserts it here.
//   3. Watched sync- /sync/history for marks the player never sees (the detail screen's
//                    watched toggle), plus a pull of /sync/watched into WatchedStore so
//                    what was watched elsewhere reads as watched here.
//
// Everything is best effort and silent on failure. A tracker that interrupts playback to
// complain about its own network is worse than one that quietly misses a report.

 * title into a tmdb id for Discover's library matching, and Trakt takes `ids: { tmdb: N }`.

 * An episode resolves through its *show*: the parent series entry supplies the title to look up
 * and the episode supplies season/number. That is both what Trakt prefers and the only shape
 * that works for a show whose current season isn't in Trakt's catalogue yet. An episode whose
 * parent series can't be resolved is dropped rather than guessed at - scrobbling the wrong show
 * writes to someone's public profile.

 *
 * ## Turning a mark back into a title
 *
 * A mark is keyed by what was watched rather than by which copy played, which is what makes it
 * work across providers - but the key is lossy on purpose: `e|breaking bad|s5|e14`, with the
 * title already normalised down for matching. Trakt needs a real title to look up.
 *
 * So the catalogue supplies it. Every series and film in [MainActivity.allChannels] is indexed by
 * the *same* normalisation the key was built with, which turns the key's title fragment back into
 * the catalogue entry it came from - and that entry has the real name and year that TMDB wants.
 * [PlaybackPositionStore] snapshots are folded in as a second source, because they carry a whole
 * [Channel] each and so cover titles that have since left the catalogue.
 *
 * A mark whose title matches neither is skipped. There is genuinely nothing to send: no title, no
 * TMDB id, no Trakt item.
 *
 * ## Not re-sending
 *
 * `/sync/watched` is pulled first and everything Trakt already holds is subtracted, so a run
 * after the first sends only what is genuinely missing and a settled library sends nothing at
 * all. That, plus the id memo, is what makes this safe to wire into the ordinary Sync now.
