 * There are two kinds of source: an installed `stream_search` plugin and built-in site scrapers.
 * Both run concurrently and their results go into one ranked queue.
 *
 * **Site sources are preferred over plugin results** - a site link starts playing in about a
 * second, whereas a plugin may need to fetch from a slow host. Plugin results are what gets tried
 * when no site carried the title.
 *
 * **Within each group: a source that played last time wins** - a setup that works should keep
 * working rather than re-deriving the answer - then dub preference when the user asked for it,
 * then quality tier, then seeders as the tie-break inside a tier.
 *
 * Nothing is presented for approval and there is no picker. The queue is walked from the top, a
 * source that fails to resolve is skipped silently - a dead host is the normal case, not an error
 * - and the dialog only reports what it is doing. Which embed host or release a stream came from
 * is not a choice anyone can make usefully: the names are interchangeable and nothing on screen
 * predicts which will work, so the app tries them instead of asking.
