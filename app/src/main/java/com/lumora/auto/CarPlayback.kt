 * independent surfaces with independent lifecycles, and the car session routinely outlives
 * (or precedes) the Activity. Audio focus arbitrates if both ever run at once.
 *
 * The catalogue comes from the on-disk channel cache rather than a fresh provider fetch -
 * the car session can start with no Activity ever having run, and a cold multi-provider
 * fetch is tens of seconds of work behind a driver waiting for a picture.
