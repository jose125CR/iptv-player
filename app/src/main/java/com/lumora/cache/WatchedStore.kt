/**
 * Watched marks keyed by *what was watched* rather than by which copy of it played.
 *
 * [PlaybackPositionStore] is keyed by a provider-scoped id (an Xtream stream id), which is the
 * right key for a resume position - that is genuinely per-file - but the wrong one for "have I
 * seen this". The same show across three IPTV panels has three ids for one episode, so watching
 * it left the other two looking untouched.
 *
 * The key here is instead derived from the title and the season/episode numbers (see
 * `MainActivity.watchedKeyFor`), using the same normalisation that already decides two catalogue
 * entries are the same title when duplicates are grouped. Any copy therefore reads as watched,
 * including copies of a provider that has never been browsed and providers added later.
 *
 * Deliberately a separate file from the position store rather than more entries in it: that
 * store caps at 500 and evicts the oldest, because it carries a whole Channel snapshot per
 * entry for Continue Watching to resume from. A mark here is one short string, so the budget
 * can be far larger - a completed long-running show is hundreds of them and must not push
 * anybody's resume points out.
 *
 * Plain newline-delimited text for the same reason [ChannelCache] is: parsing tens of thousands
 * of short lines with `split` costs a fraction of what a JSON tree does on a TV stick, and this
 * is read during startup.
