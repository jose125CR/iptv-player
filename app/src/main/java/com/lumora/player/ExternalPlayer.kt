/**
 * Hands the current stream to another video app - VLC, MX Player, Just Player, whatever the
 * user has.
 *
 * Why this exists: the app's own decoding is the device's decoding. A stick with no Dolby
 * licence has no AC3/E-AC3 MediaCodec, so those streams play with picture and no sound, and
 * ExoPlayer reports nothing wrong - an unsupported track is "unsupported", not "failed".
 * Bundling software decoders would fix it, and does, at the cost of tens of megabytes of
 * FFmpeg per ABI. VLC already has all of that installed on the same device, so the cheap fix
 * is to pass the stream over rather than to ship a second copy of FFmpeg.
 *
 * Everything here is best-effort by design: there is no standard for handing a stream to a
 * video player, so the intent carries the union of the extras the common players read and
 * each one picks out what it understands.
