 * A JS plugin script found by [PluginScriptManager.discoverScripts] - replaces

 * rendering) keeps using the same [com.lumora.plugin.DiscoveredProvider]/
 * [com.lumora.plugin.TorrentResult]/etc. shapes; only this and the manager/engine classes are
 * new.
 *
 * Nothing ships built into Lumora - every script, including the ones in Lumora's own default
 * plugin store, lives in `filesDir/plugin_scripts/` and only gets there because the user
 * explicitly installed it (browsing a store, or pasting/fetching a `.js` URL directly). There is
 * deliberately no "trusted because it's in the APK" tier: label/description text always comes
 * from the script the user chose to install, or from a store's catalog before that - never
 * hardcoded in Lumora itself.
