/**
 * Memo tables for the pure name-normalisation functions below.
 *
 * These are regex-heavy (stripDecorativeTags alone runs six replaces per call) and every
 * one of them is called on the *same* strings many times over a single catalogue load:
 * deriveLiveHalf runs once per provider merge plus once per re-render, the category-row
 * build re-derives brand prefixes from the same names in two passes, and liveQualityScore
 * is called from inside a sort comparator, so it recomputes O(n log n) times per group. On
 * a 52k-item catalogue that churned hundreds of MB of short-lived strings and Matchers, and
 * the resulting back-to-back GCs - not the disk read - were what made a cached cold start
 * take tens of seconds on a TV stick.
 *
 * Keys are the name strings the Channel objects already hold, so an entry costs the map
 * node, not a copy. Bounded and cleared wholesale on overflow: this is a hot-loop cache,
 * not a correctness-critical store, and the functions are pure so a miss only costs time.
